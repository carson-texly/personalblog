<h1 id="paint-by-numbers">paint by numbers</h1>
<p>TLDR: <a href="https://carsoncummins11.github.io/paintbynumbers/">A
website I made</a> for using paint you have for new custom paint by
numbers</p>
<p>Recently I have done several paint by numbers kits, but I almost
never used up all of the paint. It seemed like a waste to throw it all
away, so I figured I’d try to figure out a way to use it up. The issue
is I’m about as good at art as the average crypto enthusiast is at
software dev (horrible).</p>
<p>The good news is that I have a bunch of pictures, and a bunch of math
education, so I should be able to figure out some sort of solution. I
should point out before I start that several much better paint by
numbers generators exist online (two that I see are <a
href="https://paint-by-number.com/pages/create-your-own-paint-by-number">here</a>
and <a href="https://pbnify.com/">here</a>). However, both of these, and
many other examples online, prescribe color palettes to you, by actively
choosing them for you or forcing you to use colors that already exist in
the image. I already own the paint colors, so that’s not going to work
great for me. So my ideal solution is just a website that takes in my
paint colors and an image, and spits out a paint by numbers.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I’m sure the more data science aware among us could tell
me a much better algorithm for what I’m about to do, but when it comes
to learning I’m a big fan of “fuck around and find out” over “read about
someone else fucking around to find out”, so here’s my attempt at doing
and documenting that.</p>
<p>The first step in a website that takes in colors and images as inputs
is to let it take in colors and images as inputs. This is a simple
statement, and HTML makes it even simpler by having native elements for
color inputs and file uploads. I also pretend to do web dev for a
living, so I churned that out pretty quick. After a little processing,
I’m left with a list of 3-tuples representing the color palette RGB
values, and a resource url for the image. I used an image url because I
figured someone else had already written a lot of the image processing
routines I was going to need, they’d let me use a resource url to load
images in, and god forbid I try to fuck around with shaping tensors in
the way someone else expects them. I ended up using <a
href="https://github.com/image-js/image-js">image-js</a> because I
googled “images js” and that was the first thing that came up, and it
seemed to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>So now I had an image object that I can do some things to, and a list
of colors that I want said image to be. At first I tried just making
each pixel in the image the same color as whatever 3-tuple had the
closest euclidean distance to it in the color palette, but that looked
really bad. It also didn’t have the classic paint by numbers blobs of
color, which I could number, hence making it impossible to “paint by
number”. Forever unwilling to ask the internet, I guessed that blurring
it would make more homogenous blobs appear, because that’s what happens
when I take off my glasses. Image JS didn’t have an obviously available
inbuilt blur function, but I did stumble upon a convolution function, so
I thugged it out and typed out a gaussian blur kernel by hand. Then I
did the same closest euclidean distance thing on the gaussian kernel
blurred image and the resulting recolored image looked quite a bit more
like an acceptable paint by numbers painting.</p>
<p>So now that I had the “paint” part of paint by numbers figured out,
it was time for the “numbers” part, which seemed significantly scarier.
A normal paint by numbers is a bunch of numbered outlines of blobs on a
white page, not a finished painting. So I was gonna have to convert the
finished painting into a bunch of blobs, draw their outlines, and then
number those blobs according to color. Identifying blobs is actually a
super huge and important problem in data science called clustering, so
tons of famous algorithms like k-means, BIRCH, etc having been invented
to solve it super well. I did not go try and relearn that BS, I was here
to fuck around, not read about someone else fucking around.</p>
<p>My idea, which had the same amount of forethought as that squirrel
from Ice Age chasing a nut, was to make the photoshop bucket tool and
make it repeatedly click on each pixel that had not already been filled
up by previous clicks, and track what click number each pixel was filled
on. So I created a 2D int array (lets call it the “cluster ids”), where
each integer would store what number click the bucket tool had filled
that pixel on. Making the bucket tool from photoshop is really easy when
you’re okay with abusing the shit out of js function stack memory, just
make a recursive function that marks the input pixel in the “cluster
ids” array and calls itself on any pixel that is adjacent to, not marked
in “cluster ids” and the same color as the input pixel. While pretty
abusive of all sorts of memory and such, this method was pretty quick to
write and gave me what I wanted, a way to map each pixel to a specific
blob it was a part of, and to know that blob was all the same color.</p>
<p>Now that I’d made all the clusters, and it actually worked decently
well (to my surprise), I just had to draw outlines and numbers onto a
new image, which would be the final product of my website. This was
super simple using the cluster map I’d just made, I simply made every
pixel white in the new image, then made every pixel with a differently
cluster id-ed neighbor black, which drew outlines pretty easily! I’m
sure my old topology prof would give me some bs about how this was a bad
assumption, but stuff seemed to work out. Numbering the clusters turned
out to be quite a bit more difficult a problem than I’d expected, and
given that at this point I’d been coding for a few hours I threw in the
towel and churned out the first solution I could think of.</p>
<p>Getting the numbers for each blob is easy enough - just take one
pixel in the blob and sample what color it should be in the final
product. However, deciding where to draw that number is fucking HARD. An
ideal number placement is A - as central as possible and B - not
overlapping any of the black outlines. However, deciding where is “as
central as possible” in an arbitrary blob is really annoying. I’m sure
there’s been some smart research into it, but I could not figure out at
all how to make that happen, so I focused more on “not overlapping any
of the black outlines”. At the font size I was using, I needed a 10
pixel tall by 5 pixel wide outline-free rectangle to put each number in
to ensure it wouldn’t overlap anything. Obviously some Leetcode-style
bullshit was in order, and whenever that’s the case the “sliding window
algorithm” comes in handy. That’s it that was the answer it was really
dumb and I wish I thought of a smarter way to do it. Anyways, you should
check out the <a
href="https://carsoncummins11.github.io/paintbynumbers/">final
product</a>, I will not be making any updates.</p>
